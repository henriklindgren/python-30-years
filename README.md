# python-30-years
To celebrate 30 years of Python, something written against Python 0.9.1

# Instructions
1. Download python 0.9.1 from https://www.python.org/download/releases/early/
2. Extract the python-0.9.1/ folder in this projects root.
3. Change directory python-0.9.1/src/ and run `make python`, it will probably work.
4. From the src directory, run `./python ../../main.py`

Let's start out with a select message for those on a incompatible platform getting integer overflows.
Sure is nice being able to set named arguments...
...and how about formatted strings in Python (and type exception!)...
...and we all enjoy having datetime, even with its flaws (and runtime exception)...
...having some whitespace just for flavor will not break PEP8!
